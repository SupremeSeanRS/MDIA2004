                        <p>I first heard about COVID-19 roughly around mid January. At that time, I thought nothing of it, saying to myself that it's just
                            another disease and it should be over with soon. Fast forward few weeks after, many thousands of people infected in China, virus spreading
                            around the globe. I thought to myself, this is really serious because it is easy to spread and it is killing a lot of people.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is now March and I am at school (The University of The West Indies) and there were so many rumours that the coronavirus in now in Jamaica.
                            Few days later, there was a confirmed case and then couple days later there was the second. I remember at that time when I was at school, I thought
                            to myself if we're going to have to stay at home because of this disease going around. I asked a couple of classmates if they would be coming to school
                            the following day (March 12) and everyone said no. So I decided to also stay home so that I don't contract the disease and since then I've been home 24/7.
                            Since most of my classes were online classes from the beginning, It did not feel anyway for me or my classmates as we've been streaming classes from Mona
                            since the start of the 2019-2020 Academic year.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have always found streaming classes to be better than coming to the actual school as I don't have to prepare to leave my home and go to school, therefore
                            saving me roughly around two to three (2-3) hours off the road in total going to school and going back home. Staying home for me was a norm as I've always been
                            a stay at home person because of how my parents raised me, so it didn't really affected me the fact that staying at home is the new norm. The only issue that I've
                            had with staying at home however is the fact that internet and electricity goes out at random times which could affect my school work. Since staying home, I've been
                            balancing playing a lot of video games and doing school work to an extent to where I can manage doing both at the same time and that has basically been my take on
                            the pandemic/disease and staying home.
